                  <p>The scratch project was a difficult venture in which we had to create a videogame in Scratch. The videogame I created was a parkour based level by level game that was intended to be repetitive but challenging. My role was centered around building the game and designing the levels. I focused on creating the base code for all of the different functions and then also on creating specific levels. Through this project, I was able to learn how to 
                  stick with a timeframe. This was because a challenge we faced was creating the game in the time we had. Me and my partner had a lot of ideas and we had to figure out what was important so that we could stick with time. As we progressed deeper into our game, many issues arised with our code and there was a time when we became stuck on a single function we wanted to add. This was a major challenge because
                  we wasted a lot of time to figure it out. To solve the problem, I had to look at some outside sources and use the Internet to find solutions. This exemplified my work ethic as I became better at using multiple sources instead of just relying on the teacher. As a team, we performed well together as each person knew what their objectives were every single day. Overall, this project was essential as it provided a basic understanding of how coding works and allowed us to understand the difficulty of creating something under the pressure of time.</p>

                  <p>In this project, my team and I were faced with a challenge to make a car powered by hydrogen cells or solar power. Our objective was to make a lightweight vehicle that could could quickly reach a certain point with a consistent speed. On this project, I was responsible for collecting data on our vehicle and building it. Over the project, I first designed the vehicle, then slowly built it to function, and then finally made changes until it was functioning the way I wanted. Then I conducted the data collection on the car to calculate the speed of our car. Through this project, I learned that it is important to always look at all the options available. When we were building our vehicle, we made use of some materials that were too heavy and slowed our card down. After some investigation, we found out that we could have used a much lighter component to do the same function. I understood that instead of trying to finish our car in the fastest way, it was more important to find the smartest way. Over the course of this project, I believe that I have become more efficient with the way that I work. Having a limited set of materials to use on this project, I learned how to make use of everything I have in the best way possible. Also, I have become a better team player because of this project. In order to finish this project, my team and I had to make sure we were on task which helped me communicate and work with my team a lot more. Overall, this project made me use all of my skills and made me a better team worker. </p>
