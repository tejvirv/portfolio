                  <p>The scratch project was a difficult venture in which we had to create a videogame in Scratch. The videogame I created was a parkour based level by level game that was intended to be repetitive but challenging. My role was centered around building the game and designing the levels. I focused on creating the base code for all of the different functions and then also on creating specific levels. Through this project, I was able to learn how to 
                  stick with a timeframe. This was because a challenge we faced was creating the game in the time we had. Me and my partner had a lot of ideas and we had to figure out what was important so that we could stick with time. </p>

                  <p>The biggest part of my work experience has come from working at Subway for the past few years. Everyday is a challenge there because I am constantly facing new situations. It has been a learning experience as working under pressure has become one of my strengths. I also have gained many leadership skills through my work there because I have had to manage the workers that I work with. </p>
