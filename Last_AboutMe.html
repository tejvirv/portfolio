                       <p>Hello, my name is Tejvir Virk. I am currently attending Dublin High School as a senior who will be graduating in the year 2019. As a technological enthusiast, I want to have a career in software development. I want to be able to create software that makes life easier for people around the world. To pursue my career, I plan on going to college  after finishing high school. At college I want to major in software engineering and find a job in the Bay Area.

I have always loved learning about all the functions that a computer can do for me. Computers and the engaging operations that they can do have interested me a lot. Which is why it has always been my goal to one day work with computers as a job. Technology has impressed me over and over again as over the years I have delved more and more into it. I started with just playing around with different programs on my computer. But then slowly, I began to program my own systems and my love for it only increased. My passion for computers and their capacity is what has motivated me to become a software engineer as one day I want to innovate these machines for the future generations. My dream is for the upcoming generations to become fascinated with what I've created.<br></br> 

I believe that I will be successful in this career because I am a reliable and imaginative person. When I am assigned to do something, I always get my work done on time. I have done many engineering projects with teammates in my IED and POE courses. Over this time, I have learned how to work with a team effectively and am able to work properly with my teammates as I always need to finish what I am assigned in order to succeed as a team. I have also always been very imaginative when I'm working on projects. Thinking out of the box and creating something that stands out is what I thrive to do. These characteristics of mine are important and are the reason why I will do good in whatever career I choose in the future. 

Over my years as a student, I have shown my strengths through my work at school and out of it. I have earned the Honors Roll at my high school and middle school multiple times for having been consistent with my grades. An important achievement that I garnered was coding my own program for a video game. Though it was difficult, I slowly learned how to do it and finally coded my own program that functioned with a video game. Through my experiences, I have learned many skills that I can use in the future. I am able to do graphic design such as logos or posters as I have self taught myself Photoshop. I have also learnt how to code in JavaScript and create small programs. Finally, an important skill that I have is that I can communicate very well. My experience with working at a fast food restaurant where communication is essential has really boosted how I converse with people. These skills are important to me because I will use these in my work at a point of time.

I am a passionate student who is highly interested in technological advancement. My love for computers has shown me that I will continue to be interested in it for the rest of my life.<br></br> With the skills that I possess, I have learned that I will be successful in my field of work because it is truly what I am passionate about. As a student who plans to pursue engineering, I am sure that I will be able to make a change in the future with my own work. I really appreciate you for taking the time to read about me.
